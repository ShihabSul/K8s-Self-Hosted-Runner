# Web Interface

Once a PandA is on the network, it exposes a Web Interface that is accessible by typing itâ€™s ip address or hostname into a browser. This consists of a number of areas:
- Home: A summary of the Web Interface sections
- Docs: Documentation on the hardware, firmware and software that make up the device
- Control: If the Web Control package is loaded then this allows the functional blocks that make up PandA to be wired together, parameters set, and the design saved and loaded.
- Admin: Allows installation of packages from a USB key, setting up SSH keys, and other remote administration.
